    "### 1. Enviornment setup\n",
    "#### Script languages\n",
    "Scripts were developed using R, python 2.7x, and BASH scripting languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instruction on [CHROMATIX](https://bitbucket.org/aperezrathke/chr-loc-mbi-mam/src/master/) to install the required packages\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Directory structure\n",
    "We assume a working directory [WorkDir] which is freely named by the user. However, for high performance computing (HPC) scripts running on the UIC Extreme HPC cluster, the [WorkDir] path is assumed to be ~/chr-working.\n",
    "\n",
    "Via command line, navigate to [WorkDir] and git clone the CHR-FOLDER and CMX projects within this directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://bitbucket.org/aperezrathke/chr-folder.git folder\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will copy the source code for the 3-D chromatin folder into the [WorkDir]/folder subdirectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://bitbucket.org/aperezrathke/cmx.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will copy the source code for the Bayesian Hi-C single-cell deconvolver into the [WorkDir]/cmx subdirectory.\n",
    "Next, still from within [WorkDir], clone the MBI-MAM project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://bitbucket.org/aperezrathke/chr-loc-mbi-mam.git ./loci/mbi-mam\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will copy the scripts for many-body analysis of the GM12878 cell line into the [WorkDir]/loci/mbi-mam subdirectory.\n",
    "We will refer to the local path [WorkDir]/loci/mbi-mam as [RepoDir].\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Output directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, within [RepoDir], many scripts will generate output data to the directory [RepoDir]/gm12878/fractal2d.hic5k.tad2mb/output. This folder is generated automatically when needed. All script output is stored within this directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Baking\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the GM12878 common subdirectory at [RepoDir]/gm12878/fractal2d.hic5kb.tad2mb/common.\n",
    "\n",
    "From within a command line terminal, run the bake.py script. This will work for most standard linux environments such as Ubuntu or CentOs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Null distribution\n",
    "The next step is to generate a uniform random chromatin 3-D polymer ensemble. This 3-D polymer ensemble will be repeatedly bootstrapped to generate a null distribution over chromatin contact frequencies. Using this bootstrapped distribution, we can then call non-random (i.e. significant or not well explained through uniform random polymer folding) chromatin interactions within the Hi-C.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. Navigate to the GM12878 null subdirectory at [RepoDir]/gm12878/fractal2d.hic5kb.tad2mb/null.\n",
    "- 2. Run the script `null_folder_run.py`. This will generate a large ensemble of uniform random 3-D chromatin polymers.\n",
    "- 3. Run the script `null_blb_run_parallel.sh` to generate the bootstrap null distribution over chromatin contact frequencies. Note, this script simply spawns multiple instances of the `null_blb_run.py` script to generate multiple Bag of Little Bootstraps (BLB) replicates.\n",
    "- 4. Run the script `null_cache_run.sh`. This will convert the output from the previous steps into RData format usable for R analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling non-random interactions\n",
    "We can now use the bootstrap null distribution to call non-random interactions within the Hi-C data. However, first we must identify the TAD regions of interest and pull down the corresponding Hi-C data from Rao et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "All scripts will be located in the the GM12878 common subdirectory at [RepoDir]/gm12878/fractal2d.hic5kb.tad2mb/common.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identify and format loci for analyzing\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare the table of loci you are interested in, in the format of \n",
    "\n",
    "| name | chr | bp_start_tad_med | bp_end_tad_med |\n",
    "|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n",
    "|chr2.230805000.231690000|chr2|230805000|231690000|\n",
    "| ...\t| ...\t| ...\t| ... |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the script `tad_juicer.py`. This will process the table of loci we are interested in and process 4DN downloaded Hi-C data using Juicer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clean TADs\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have downloaded the Hi-C and generated the null distribution, we can now call the non-random interactions within the Hi-C. We call this process cleaning the data - i.e. retaining only the non-random interactions for subsequent downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the script `tad_clean_run.sh`. This will call non-random interactions at each TAD listed within the master table of TAD regions. It will also generate corresponding heat maps.\n"
